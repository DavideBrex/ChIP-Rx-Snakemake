**Under development**

A Snakemake workflow for the anlysis of ChIP-Rx data, i.e ChIP-Seq with reference exogenous genome spike-in normalization


## Usage

The usage of this workflow is described in the [Snakemake Workflow Catalog](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/?usage=DavideBrex%2FChIP-Rx-snakemake).

If you use this workflow in a paper, don't forget to give credits to the authors by citing the URL of this (original) ChIP-Rx-snakemakesitory and its DOI (see above).

# TODO

* Replace `DavideBrex` and `ChIP-Rx-snakemake` everywhere in the template (also under .github/workflows) with the correct `ChIP-Rx-snakemake` name and owning user or organization.
* Replace `<name>` with the workflow name (can be the same as `ChIP-Rx-snakemake`).
* Replace `<description>` with a description of what the workflow does.
* The workflow will occur in the snakemake-workflow-catalog once it has been made public. Then the link under "Usage" will point to the usage instructions if `DavideBrex` and `ChIP-Rx-snakemake` were correctly set.
